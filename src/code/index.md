## Hi there!

You're a coder and we love you â€“ you've come to the right place.

### What is this?

The ZALORA styleguide gives you an overview of available UI Components on our Desktop and Mobile platforms. Think of it as a Bootstrap Framework.

### Desktop

We keep available UI components and global styling for desktop platforms in an extra Github repository called [global-scss](http://github.com/zalora/global-scss) which is included as a git submodule in our shop.

### Mobile

The same goes for mobile UI Components. Styling and components for mobile live in [mobile-scss](http://github.com/zalora/mobile-scss) and also get included as a submodule in the shop.
