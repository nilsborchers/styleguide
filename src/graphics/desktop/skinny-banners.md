## Before adding a skinny banner at any stage of the funnel, think again. You may have just committed a skinny banner crime …

### Your banner is distracting the user from conversion …

… if you show a sale banner or make a banner clickable without any immediate benefit at the checkout
and cart pages!

Also, if the banner can contain the campaign details, there is no need for it to be clickable - the hover
over tooltip function should be made full use of.
If you do need a landing page with step-by-step instructions and screenshots, consider opening content
in a new tab.

If the user has not completed the desired action on the current page or will have to go back to the
current page, the target page should be opened in a new tab (e.g shipping information).
Do not link skinny banners to categories, New Arrivals, or the Sale page simply because you are not sure
where to link it - just leave it non-clickable.

### Your banner may not be relevant for every shopper …

… if you feature a menswear banner on a women’s page. Although there may be small percentage
of users to whom this banner will be relevant, it will not be relevant to the majority that see it. It
means we would have wasted the space or even worse, distracted users from their journey to conversion.
If you want to reach out to smaller user groups, consider targeting! For example: Does it make
sense to use DCM to show this banner to new visitors only?
