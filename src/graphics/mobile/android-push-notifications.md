The ZALORA app now supports Advanced Rich Push Notifications on the new Android SDK, which means that basic push notifications can now be accompanied by an image.

When designing Rich Push banners, bear in mind that the accompanying image is a complement to the push message and the purpose is to engage the user with visual appeal.

Mobile-optimised text sizes are once again key, and these are the recommended sizes:

<p class="example-container" style="text-align: center;">
<img src="/assets/images/content/onsite/desktop/rich-push-notifications.jpg"/>
</p>
