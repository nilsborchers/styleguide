## Introduction

In the last few years mobile design has exploded - the mobile arena introduced a new layer of complexity for designers.

In our day-to-day work, we typically derive our mobile creatives from what we’ve already designed for desktop, but consider this - mobile screens have a very different scale and size from desktop screens. factors like readability and usability are unfortunately overlooked when we don’t test our designs on an actual mobile device.

Design plays an important role in building lasting relationships with end users and, thus, in supporting the brand’s promise. in this document, you will find guidelines and tips on designing for our app, mobile web and mobile static pages. these are provided to keep our visual identity unified and to build a usable & enjoyable mobile experience our customers.
