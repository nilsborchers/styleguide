### HTML Formatting

* Use lowercase letters within element names, attributes, and values
* Indent nested elements properly
* Strictly use double quotes, not single or completely omitted quotes
* Remove the forward slash at the end of self-closing elements


### CSS Ruleset Declaration

	.selector1, 
	.selector2,
	.selector3 {
	    display: block;
	    background-color: green;
	    color: red;
	}

In above snippet we have

* a space before our opening brace ({)
* properties and values on the same line
* a space after our propertyâ€“value delimiting colon (:)
* each declaration on its own new line
* the opening brace ({) on the same line as our last selector
* our first declaration on a new line after our opening brace ({)
* our closing brace (}) on its own new line
* each declaration indented by four (4) spaces
* a trailing semi-colon (;) on our last declaration.
